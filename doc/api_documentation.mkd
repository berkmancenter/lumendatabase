## Create notice

Submits a new Notice to the chillingeffects system via JSON-encoded parameters.
There are several different "Notice Types," these are essentially subclasses of
the abstract Notice class.  "Notice Types" allow us to track notice-specific
attributes and create serialized representations with logical attribute names.
Please see **Notice Type Mapping** below, which defines what attributes are
remapped for each Notice Type.

An `authentication_token` is required to submit via the API. Please ask
Chilling Effects staff for your authentication token.

**Method**: `POST`

**Endpoint**: `https://chillingeffects.org/notices`

### Authentication

Submissions through the API **must** be authenticated by including an 
Authentication Token. Tokens will be provided by Chilling Effects upon 
request.

The Token may be included as a parameter or header.

* Parameter: `authentication_token`

```
curl -H "Accept: application/json" \
     -H "Content-type: application/json" \
     -d '{ "authentication_token": "abc123", "notice": {...} }' \
     'https://chillingeffects.org/notices'
```

* Request Header: `AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN`

```
curl -H "Accept: application/json" \
     -H "Content-type: application/json" \
     -H "AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN: abc123" \
     -d '{ "notice": {...} }' \
     'https://chillingeffects.org/notices'
```

If the Authentication Token is missing or invalid, an empty response 
will be returned with HTTP status 401 (Unauthorized).

In the Example Request below, we include `-v` as a flag for curl to make the fetching verbose.  
In order to obtain more information, and for alternatives to `-v`, refer to the curl Unix man page
by typing `man curl`.

## Notice Type Mapping

All notices are added to the system through the API using the same named
parameters (see **Create Notice** above). However, fields are "mapped"
depending on the Notice Type when serialized as JSON through a search request
or when requested individually.

## Search notices via fulltext

Chillingeffects allows for paginatable full-text searches of notices and
relevant metadata. Results are sorted with the most relevant at the top. Notice
search results contain the same data as an individually-requested Notice, with
an additional "score" field. "score" articulates how "relevant" this result is
to the query term. Higher numbers are more relevant. If you do not have a 
researcher API token you will limited to 25 results per request and 3 requests 
per minute. Contact Chilling Effects administrators to request a researcher token.

Terms are joined with an 'OR' by default.

### `*-require-all` parameters

Let's say we're searching for notices with "George Jetsen" in the title.
By default, the search engine will search for notices with "George OR Jetsen".

If you include 'title-require-all=yes' in your query, then the search engine will
search for notices with "George AND Jetsen" in the title, narrowing down your
results considerably.

The various `*-require-all` parameters need a non-null value to be enabled -
"true" or "yes" are both acceptable.

how facets are formatted by submitting facet-less fulltext queries and then
