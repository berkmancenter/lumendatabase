      <p>Please note that Lumen offers this counternotice generator form purely as a formatting convenience for users.</p>
      <p>Filling out this form will present you with a copy of properly formated DMCA counternotice, which you must then save or copy in order to send it to its intended recipient by whatever means you choose.</p>
      <p>Filling out the form will NOT store the counternotice in Lumen's database or send it to involved parties, nor can Lumen do anything with the information entered into the form.</p>
      <p>Lumen is not the sender or original recipient of the DMCA notices within its database, and is not responsible in any way for either removing or restoring on-line content from the web or search engine listings, or for &quot;blocking&quot; or restoring access to websites or URLs.</p>
      <p>Lumen is not the correct recipient of a counternotice and cannot take action of any kind on one.</p>
